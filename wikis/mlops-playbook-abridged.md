### 1.1 MLOps Overview

- The MLOps Lifecycle is a continuous loop that can be broken down into several key stages. It is an iterative cycle of experimentation, deployment and improvement.

#### Experimentation and Development

- This is the initial phase where data scientists and ML engineers explore data, train models, and experiment with different algorithms. The focus is rapid iteration and tracking experiments.

**Key Activities**:
- **Data Exploration and Feature Engineering**: Prepare and transform raw data into features suitable for model training.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Building and training various models, then evaluating performance based on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Includes cross-validation and train/validation/test splits.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Logging parameters (data based), hyperparameters (model based), metrics, artifacts (models, datasets), and environment details (libraries, runtime) for each experiment, ensuring reproducability and a clear history.

#### CICD for ML

- Once a model is ready for deployment, the CI/CD pipeline automates the process of getting it into production.

**CI for ML**:
- Differs from Traditional CI. Involves testing code as well as data and the trained model. A robust CI pipeline automatically retrains the models when new data becomes available or underlying code changes.

**CD for ML**:
- This stage automates deployment of trained model to production (dev, stage, etc) as a web service, batch processing job or to an edge device.

#### Operations and Monitoring

After a model is deployed, MLOps focuses on ensuring its performance and stability over time.

- **Model Monitoring**: a critical part of MLOps. It involves monitoring the models performance on live data, looking for signs of *Model Drift* or *Data Drift*:
    - **Model drift**: AKA Concept drift. The relationship between input features and target variable has changed.
    - **Data drift**: The statistical properties of the incoming data have changed, causing teh model to perform poorly.

- **Retraining and Redeployment**: When monitoring indicates a decline in performance, the model needs to be retrained on new data. This triggers the entire MLOps pipeline from experimentation to deployment.


### 1.2 Team & Roles

MLOps is inherently cross-disciplinary, it bridges the gap between different teams and stakeholders.

**Key Roles**:
- **Data Scientists**:
    - Focus on research, data exploration, feature engineering, and model development.
    - Define business problems as ML tasks and evaluate models with appropriate metrics.
- **ML Engineers**:
    - Productionize models: Optimize, refactor, and package for scalable deployment.
    - Build pipelines for training, evaluation, and serving.
    - Bridge handoff between research (data scientists) and operations (DevOps).
- **DevOps / MLOps Engineers**:
    - Ensure reliable infrastructure for training and serving (Cloud, K8, CI/CD).
    - Manage deployment automation, versioning, monitoring and scalability.
    - Apply DevOps principles of automation, reproducability, observability to ML systems.
- **Data Engineers**:
    - Build and Maintain data pipelines to provide clean, reliable, and timely data.
    - Handle data ingestion, transformation and storage at scale (ETL/Data lake)
- **Product Managers / Business Stakeholders**:
    - Align model development with business objectives and KPIs.
    - Prioritize experiements and balance trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

### 1.3 Maturity Assessment

#### Level 0: Manual Process (No MLOps)

This is the starting point for most orgs. ML models are developed and deployed in an ad-hoc, manual fashion.

- **Process**: Data scientists train models on their local machines or notebooks. Model artifacts are manually passed to a separate team for deployment, which is often a one-off event.

- **Pain Points**: Lack of reproducibility, no version control for data or models, no monitoring, and significant delays in deploying and updating models. This approach is brittle and not scalable.


#### Level 1: ML Pipeline Automation

At this level, some parts of the ML pipeline are automated. The focus is on automating the model training and deployment process with a *repeatable pipeline*.

- **Process**: A *CI/CD pipeline* is introduced, automating the training and deployment of the model. When a new model is trained, the pipeline automatically packages and deploys it.

- **Key Enablers**: Use of a centralized ML platform (e.g., `Kubeflow`, `MLflow`) and version control for model code and data. This level reduces manual errors and improves deployment speed.

#### Level 2: CI/CD

This level extends the existing CI/CD to the entire ML Lifecycle. It's about creating a fully integrated, automated system that responds to changes in code, data or environment.

- **Process**: The pipeline automatically triggers on code commits or data changes. Automated tests are run on the data, code, and model before deployment. *A/B testing* and *canary deployments* are often implemented to safely roll out new models.

- **Key Enablers**: Robust data and model validation tests, automated monitoring for data and concept drift, and integrated CI/CD tools. This level ensures a high degree of reliability and reproducibility.

#### Level 3: Automated and Monitored Pipelines

This level focuses on the operational aspects of MLOps. The pipeline is not only automated, but now continuously monitored for performance and triggered for retraining. 


- **Process**: The system automatically monitors model performance in production. When a decline in performance is detected (e.g., due to data or concept drift), the system automatically triggers a new training run and, if successful, a redeployment of the new model. This creates a fully autonomous feedback loop.

- **Key Enablers**: Advanced monitoring dashboards, alerting systems, and automated retraining triggers. This level reduces the need for constant human intervention and ensures models stay relevant over time.


#### Level 4: Self-Healing and Governance

This is the *pinnacle* of MLOps maturity. The system is not only automated but also *self-correcting* and fully integrated with robust governance and security practices.

- **Process**: The platform includes self-healing capabilities, automatically recovering from pipeline failures or model serving issues. There are integrated governance features for model lineage, auditing, and compliance.

- **Key Enablers**: Advanced platform orchestration, automated security scans, and a comprehensive audit trail for every model and data version. This level is characteristic of highly regulated industries or large-scale, mission-critical ML applications.

- **Relevant tools**:
    - **Workflow Orchestration and Automation**: Kubeflow pipelines, Airflow, Dagster, Argo.
    - **Model Monitoring and Detection Drift**: WhyLabs, Prometheus/Grafana, Fiddler AI.
    - **Experiment Tracking and Registry**: MLFlow, W&B,, Vertex AI Model Registry.
    - **CI/CD**: Jenkins, Github Actions, Tekton, DVC (for versioning datasets).
    - **Serving and Deployment**: KFServing, Seldon Core, BentoML, Azure ML Endpoints.
    - **Alerting and Incidents**: Grafana Alerting, Opsgenie, CloudWatch.


## Infrastructure

### 2.1 Compute & Storage

Idenfifying the proper compute and storage solutions is fundamental to an MLOps platform's performance and cost effectiveness. The requirements for ML workloads differ significantly from traditional approaches, especially relating to data volume and computational intensity. The main purpose is to provide scalable, reliable resources for training, serving and storing ML workloads and data.

**Compute**:
- **CPUs**: The standard for data preprocessing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and serving simple models. Versatile and cost-effective for general-purpose tasks.
- **GPUs**: Essential for *deep learning* and other types of parallilizable workloads. GPUs accelerate *matrix multiplication* and other operations for training large models, thus drastically reducing training time. Cloud providers offer GPU optimized instances (think `NVIDIA`).
- **TPUs**: Tensor Processing Units are Google's custom-built ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) designed specifically for machine learning, especially for training large-scale models. High performant, but less flexible than GPUs.

- **Best Practices**:
    - Use autoscaling clusters for unpredictable workloads.
    - Leverage Spot instances for non-critical training jobs!

**Storage**:
- **Object Storage**: Cloud services (S3, GCS, Blob) are the standard for storing raw and processed data. They are highly scalable, durable and cost-effective. Ideal for massive datasets used in ML.
- **Network File Systems (NFS)**: Used for shared storage that can be mounted on multiple instances, often for faster access to data during training, or for sharing model artifacts within a cluster.
- **Data WareHouses / Lakes**: Essential for managing large, structured, and unstructured datasets. A data lake stores raw data in its native format, while a data warehouse stores structured, processed data for analytics/reporting. A **feature store** is a specialized data store that serves pre-computed features to both training and serving pipelines, ensuring consistency.

- **Best Practices**:
    - Always separate Raw, Curated and Production-ready datasets (Medallion architecture)
    - Raw Data: Object storage like S3, GCS, Azure Blob, Data Lakes.
    - Feature Storage: Feature stores like Feast, Tecton, Vertex AI Store.
    - Model Storage: Model registries like MLflow, Vertex AI, SafeMaker, Azure ML.
    - Artifact Storage: Versioned storage using DVC, Git, MLFlow artifacts.
    - Logging/Monitoring: Time-series DBs (Prometheus, InfluxDB, ElasticSearch)

**On-Prem Considerations**:
    - Hardware procurement times
    - GPU Clusters for training workloads.
    - Network bandwidth for data transfers.
    - Compliance Requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)

### 2.2 Containers & Orchestration

*Containers* and *orchestration* tools are the backbone of modern, scalable MLOps infrastructure. They provide a reproducible and portable environment for running ML workflows.

**Containers**: A container packages an application and all its dependencies (code, runtime, libraries) into a single, isolated unit (e.g Docker). Using containers for ML pipelines solves the *"it works on my machine"* problem by ensuring that the exact same environment used for development is used for production. This is critical for reproducibility, as ML models are sensitive to library versions and environment configurations.

- **Best Practices for Containers**:
    - Use lightweight base images (e.g. `python:slim`)
    - Pin dependency versions.
    - Include custom CA certs, GPU drivers and runtime libs wherever necessary.
    - **ALWAYS** scan your images for vulnerabilities.



**Orchestration**: Orchestration tools manage the lifecycle of containers at scale.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: The industry standard for container orchestration. Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. For MLOps, it's used to manage compute clusters for model training and to run model-serving microservices.

- **Kubeflow**: An open-source project *built on Kubernetes clusters*, specifically designed to make ML pipelines portable and scalable. It provides a platform for running Jupyter notebooks, training models, and deploying them to production. Installed using Kustomize, Helm, or Manifests from Github.

- **Best Practices for Orchestration**:
    - If using the same cluster, isolate environments with namespaces.
    - ALWAYS define resource requests and limits for pods.
    - Apply autoscaling preferences: HPA/VPA for inference, and the cluster autoscaler for training.
    - Treat the infrastructure as code (Terraform, OpenTofu, Helm, Kustomize)

### 2.3 Security

*Security* in MLOps is a multi-layered concern that extends beyond traditional application security to include data, models, and the ML platform itself. All aspects of security must be considered, including using service accounts for automation, Vnet isolation, encryption and more.

**Data Security**: Protecting sensitive data. Mask or anonymize sensitive features, monitor for *data exfiltration*.
- **Encryption**: Data should be encrypted both in transit (TLS) and at rest (e.g. encrypted storage buckets). Keys can be customer managed or cloud managed. Use database encryption (TDE, field-level encryption). Use T-SQL to control Row and Column level security.
- **Access Control**: Use Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**) to restrict who can access, modify or delete a dataset or model. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.


**Model Security**: The models themselves must be secured. Control access and protect the endpoints with API rate limiting, model encryption and obfuscation. 
- **Model Tampering**: Ensure the integrity of models from training to deployment to prevent malicious actors from injecting backdoors. Use digital signatures or hash checks to verify model artifacts. Use model *watermarking* and *logging* to detect misuse.
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Subtle changes to input data can cause the model to make incorrect predictions. MLOps security involves monitoring and mitigating these attacks (e.g. evasion, poisoning).

**Infrastructure Security**: The MLOps pipeline itself, including the surrounding infrastructure, must be secured.
- **Network Security**: Secure VPC/Virtual Networks using a Firewall. Consider *private endpoints* for sensitive services to prevent exposure to the internet. Utilize network policies in Kubernetes.
- **Secrets Management**: Use Hashicorp Vault or cloud Key Vault service to store secrets including API keys, credentials and other sensitive information. Github and other Enterprise git services can hold secrets securely for each repository. NEVER hardcode a secret. Rotate credentials regularly.
- **Image Scanning**: Automatically scan a container image for vulnerabilities (Aqua, cloud-native scanners)
- **Least Privelege**: Apply this principle to all services and users at every step of the process, to ensure everyone has only the permissions they need for the task.
- **Audit and Compliance**: Centralized logging either in ELK, Splunk to observe the entire environment. Automate compliance checks with Cloud tools or others like OPA. Consider data retention policies and right to deletion compliance (GDPR). Keep up with regular penetration testing and up-to-date incident response procedures.

## Data and Model Management

### 3.1 Version Control Strategy

In MLOps, *version control* goes beyond the code to include the data and the models, which are often large binary files. This is essential for collaboration, reproducability, auditing, and rolling back to previous versions if issues arise.

**Sample Repository Structure**:

```txt
ml-project/
├── src/                    # Source code
│   ├── data/              # Data processing
│   ├── features/          # Feature engineering
│   ├── models/            # Model training code
│   └── serving/           # Model serving code
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks
├── tests/                 # Unit and integration tests
├── configs/               # Configuration files
├── dockerfiles/           # Container definitions
├── .dvcignore             # DVC ignore patterns
├── dvc.yaml               # DVC pipeline definition
└── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
```

**Code Versioning**:
- Use Git as the foundation for all ML code (Notebooks, scripts, configs, pipeline definitions).
- Adopt *branching strategies* (**GitFlow**, trunk-based) aligned with your team's CI/CD practices.
- Store pipeline definitions alongside application code (EVERYTHING should be code!).

**Data Versioning**:
- Datasets change over time, and a model trained on one version of data will produce different results from one trained on another. We need to track these changes. Two popular options are:
1. **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**: An extension for Git that handles klarge files by storing pointers in the repository.
1. **Data Version Control (DVC)**: **DVC** is specifically built for MLOps. It works alongside Git to version large datasets and ML models. It creates a `.dvc` file that points to the actual data in remote locations. In addition, DVC allows for data stages integrated with python scripts to manipulate data.
- Establish policies for *Raw data* (immutable), *Curated Data* (versioned and auditable), *Production-ready* (stable contracts/schema). 

- Use `.dvcignore` to exclude temporary files.

**Model Versioning**:
- The *trained model* is the most important artifact of an ML pipeline. Model *binries* are stored as pickle, joblib, or ONNX types for example. Each time a model is trained, it should be treated as a new version. Version metadata includes: Code commit hash, data version, training environment, and hyperparameters and metrics.
- **MD5/SSHA Hashes**: basic way to track models by using the hash of the file.
- **Model Registry**: Think of a model registry like a docker container registry. More info in 3.3. For exmample, DVC Studio model registy is enabled on top of Git.

- Model Version naming convention: 
`model-name-v{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{experiment-id}-fraud-detection-v2.1.0-exp-4a3f2b1`


### 3.2 Data Pipelines

Data pipelines automate data ingestion, transformation, validation, and delivery to training and inference systems. A reliable and automated data pipeline ensures the model always has access to fresh, clean, and validated data. Consider *batch* (`Spark`, `Flink`, `Beam`) vs *stream* (`Kafka`, `Spark Streaming`, `Flink`) processing patterns.

**General Pipeline Stages**:
1. **Ingestion**: This is the process of collecting and loading raw data from various sources (databases, APIs, streaming) into a data lake. Be minful of data types, structured vs unstructured data, etc.
1. **Validation**: Before data is used for training, it must be validated. Checking for schema changes, missing values, outliers. Any unexpected changes in data can break the pipeline. Vaslidation tools like Great Expectations, Deequ, and TFX Data Validation can be useful.
1. **Transformation and Feature Engineering**: This stage involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming raw data into features suitable for model training. This includes aggregations, encoding, scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler) and temporal features.
1. **Orchestration**: DVC pipelines are lightweight and integrate easily into existing workflows. Tools like Apache Airflow, Prefect or Dagster can be used to orchestrate Data pipelines as well. They define a sequence of tasks (DAGS - Directed Acyclic Graphs) that run automatically with clear scheduling, monitoring and error handling capabilities.

- Use *DVC Pipelines* for lightweight reproducable ML workflows, or use *Airflow* or *Kubeflow* when you need more robust pipelines.

- Pipeline monitoring should be in place to check for data freshness, and monitor pipeline health (CPU, Memory, I/O metrics).

## 3.3 Model Registry

The *Model Registry* is a centralized, version-controlled repo for managing the lifecycle of trained ML models. It is a critical component for promoting collaboration, reproducibility, and governance.

- **Centralized Storage**: A Model Registry provides a single source of truth for all models in an organization. This prevents model proliferation and confusion, where different teams might be using different versions of the same model.

- **Version and Stage Management**: It tracks the version history of each model, from experimentation to production. Models can be assigned different stages (e.g., `Staging`, `Production`, `Archived`), providing a clear state for each model and controlling its readiness for deployment. This is crucial for managing the model release process.

- **Metadata and Provenance**: A robust registry stores crucial metadata about each model version, including the training data used, the hyperparameters, the code commit hash, and the performance metrics. This *provenance data* is invaluable for auditing, debugging, and reproducing results.

**Deployment Integration**: The Model Registry integrates directly with the CI/CD pipeline. When a new model version is approved for production, the pipeline can automatically retrieve it from the registry and deploy it to the serving environment. Define a **model promotion workflow** that can validate models and promote from the registry, including *A/B testing* integration patterns.

## ML Pipelines
*Machine learning pipelines* enable the seamless flow of data, code, and models from experimentation to production. A well-designed pipeline ensures reproducibility, scalability, and reliability of the ML lifecycle.

### 4.1 Training Automation

*Training automation* refers to the process of using scripts and tools to automatically retrain an ML model. This is crucial for keeping models current and relevant as new data becomes available. An automated system can periodically pull fresh data, preprocess it, and kick off a new training run. This is often triggered by a schedule (daily or weekly) upon a new data arrival, or a decline in model performance. The automated process logs all parameters, artifacts, and metrics, ensuring reproducibility and a clear history of all model versions.

**Key Practices**:
- **Scheduled Training**: Automate retraining jobs with orchestration tools (e.g., `Airflow`, `Kubeflow`, `MLflow`, `Azure ML Pipelines`).
- **Event-driven Triggers**: Initiate training when new data arrives or when data drift is detected.
- **Reproducability**: Store training code, hyperparameters, and environment configuration in version control.
- **Scalability**: Use distributed training on GPUs/TPUs for large datasets.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Treat ML code like application code by running unit tests, linting, and automated builds before training (Github Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.).

**Metrics to Track:**  
- `Accuracy`: The proportion of all predictions that were correct, providing an overall effectiveness measure of the model.
- `precision`: The proportion of *true positive* predictions among all positive predictions, reflecting how many selected items were relevant.
- `recall`: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives, indicating how well the model identifies relevant cases.
- `F1-score`: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics into a single indicator of a model's effectiveness.
- `ROC AUC`: The *area under the receiver operating characteristic curve*, summarizing the model's ability to distinguish between classes at various threshold settings.
- `latency`: The time delay between input and output, measuring how quickly a system produces results.
- `memory footprint`: The total amount of RAM or storage required by a model or system during operation.
- `fairness metrics`: Quantitative measures that assess whether a model's outcomes are unbiased across different demographic or protected groups.



### 4.2 Model Validation

*Model validation* is a critical step in the ML pipeline that ensures a trained model meets *performance* and *quality* standards before it's deployed. It involves a comprehensive evaluation against a *held-out validation dataset*. This typically includes:
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating the model using key metrics relevant to the problem (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression).
- **Bias and Fairness Checks**: Assessing the model's performance across different demographic groups or data segments to ensure it doesn't disproportionately underperform for specific groups.
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing the new model's performance against the currently deployed model (**the "champion"**) to see if it provides a measurable improvement.

Only models that pass these checks are considered for deployment, preventing a poor-performing or biased model from going live.

### 4.3 Deployment Strategies

Deployment strategies in MLOps focus on delivering models into production reliably while minimizing risk and downtime.

**Common strategies:**
- **Batch Deployment:** Periodic model runs on stored datasets (ETL-style).
- **Online Deployment (Real-time Inference):** Expose models as APIs using containers and serving frameworks (e.g., Seldon, KFServing, BentoML, TorchServe).
- **Shadow Deployment:** The new model runs in the background, receiving the same input as the current production model, but its output is ignored. This lets you monitor its performance and behavior in a live environment without affecting users. If the new model performs as expected, it can be promoted to a live role.
- **Canary Releases:** Gradually roll out the model to a subset of users before full rollout. This allows for controlled, phased rollouts and easy rollback if issues arise.
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Maintain two environments (old vs. new) and switch traffic once the new model is validated. 
- **Multi-Model Serving:** Host multiple versions of models for A/B testing or per-customer customization.
- **Rollback & Recovery:** Ensure versioned model artifacts and data snapshots to allow safe rollbacks.

**Tools & Frameworks:**  
KFServing, Seldon Core, BentoML, MLflow Model Registry, SageMaker Endpoints, Azure ML Endpoints.
More about these tools in section 7.


## Testing & Quality

*Testing* in MLOps extends beyond traditional software testing to encompass data quality, model performance, and system reliability. A comprehensive testing strategy ensures that ML systems are robust, reliable, and maintain high quality throughout their lifecycle.

### 5.1 Testing Framework

A solid testing framework ensures every component of the ML lifecycle behaves as expected.

**Key practices:**
- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Validate individual functions (e.g., feature transformations, preprocessing logic).
- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Test full workflows (e.g., ETL pipeline + model training + prediction API).
- **Model-Specific Tests:**  
  - Validate input/output schema (catch breaking changes in feature sets).  
  - Check invariants (e.g., prediction probabilities sum to 1).  
  - Regression tests: ensure new model versions outperform or match baselines.
- **Mocking & Simulation:**  
  - Simulate external services (e.g., feature store, APIs) to test ML code in isolation.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulates entire pipeline, from raw data input to a deployed model's prediction, to ensure the full system functions as expected.
- **Frameworks to Use:**  
  - Python: `pytest`, `unittest`, `hypothesis`  
  - Data/ML: `great_expectations`, `deepchecks`, `pytest-ml`

### 5.2 Data Quality

*Data quality* directly impacts model performance; poor data leads to poor models.

**Key practices:**
- **Validation on Ingest:**  
  - Run schema and type checks at ingestion (e.g., `Great Expectations`, `Deequ`).
- **Statistical Profiling:**  
  - Detect anomalies, missing values, or skewed distributions.  
  - Example: sudden spike in nulls for `transaction_amount`.
- **Drift Detection:**  
  - Monitor data distribution vs. training baseline to detect drift.
- **Business Rule Enforcement:**  
  - Ensure domain constraints (`age ≥ 0`, `transaction date ≤ today`).  
  - Reject or quarantine invalid records.
- **Data Contracts:**  
  - Define and enforce expectations between producers and consumers of data.

**Tools:**  
`Great Expectations`, `Deequ`, `Soda`, `TFX Data Validation`.


### 5.3 Performance Testing

*Performance testing* is critical for ensuring that machine learning (ML) services consistently meet production Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for **latency**, **throughput**, and **scalability** across various deployment environments.

**Types of Performance Tests**: 
- **Model Latency Testing**:
    - Assess response times for both single-inference requests and batch processing jobs to ensure predictions are delivered within acceptable time frames.
- **Load Testing**:
    - Simulate high volumes of concurrent API requests using tools such as Locust, JMeter, or K6, revealing bottlenecks and helping validate service robustness under peak usage.
- **Scalability Tests**:
    - Examine system behavior when scaling horizontally (i.e. K8 autoscaling or cloud-managed inference endpoints), verifying that performance remains stable as traffic ramps up.
- **Resource Profiling**:
    - Analyze consumption of CPU, GPU, and memory resources during both model training and inference, which helps identify inefficiencies and ensures infrastructure is *right-sized*.
- **End-to-End SLA Validation**:
    - Measure and validate the total time taken across the ML pipeline—from ETL, model training, validation, and deployment—to confirm alignment with business or operational deadlines.

**Some Metrics to Track**:
- **P95 / P99 Latency**:
    - `95th` and `99th` percentile response times highlight worst-case delays, ensuring that even edge-case predictions meet latency requirements.
- **Requests Per Second (Throughput)**:
    - The volume of requests successfully processed per second reflects the system’s capacity to serve real-time or batch workloads.
- **GPU Utilization (%)**:
    - Monitoring *graphics processor* usage indicates whether resources are optimally leveraged or under-/over-utilized during computation-heavy operations.
- **Time-to-Train vs. Retraining Window**:
    - Compare actual model retraining times against expected SLAs to ensure new models are deployed swiftly and without bottlenecks.


## Operations

*Operations* in MLOps focus on the deployment, management, and maintenance of ML models in production. It's about ensuring the system is reliable, available, and responsive to issues.

### 6.1 Monitoring & Alerting

**Monitoring and alerting** are essential for maintaining the health of a deployed model. It involves continuous tracking of key metrics to identify performance degradation, operational failures, or data issues.

- **Operational Monitoring**: Tracks system-level metrics such as CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, and request latency to ensure the serving infrastructure is healthy.
- **Model Monitoring**: Observes model-specific metrics in real-time, including:
    - **Prediction Drift**: Changes in the model's output distribution.
    - **Data Drift**: Changes in the distribution of input features.
    - **Performance Decay**: A drop in the model's accuracy, precision, or other business-relevant metrics over time.
- **Alerting**: Automated notifications are triggered when a monitored metric crosses a predefined threshold, allowing teams to respond to issues proactively.

**Alerting best practices:**
- Alert on **symptoms, not just causes** (e.g., `“model predictions off baseline”` instead of raw GPU spike).
- Use severity levels (`info`, `warning`, `critical`).
- Route alerts to on-call engineers via Slack, PagerDuty, OpsGenie.

### 6.2 CI/CD Automation

*CI/CD* in MLOps automates building, testing, and deploying ML artifacts. Catch bugs early and often; and deploy in a seamless workflow.

**CI (Continuous Integration):**
- Code linting, unit tests, style checks.
- Data validation pipelines (schema + statistical tests).
- Model training jobs triggered on commit or dataset change.
- Store artifacts in MLflow or model registry.

**CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):**
- Automate deployment of models as APIs or batch jobs.
- Support blue-green or canary rollouts.
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm, ArgoCD) for reproducible environments.

**Common tooling:**
- `GitHub Actions`, `GitLab CI`, `Azure DevOps`, `Jenkins`. (ML-Specific: MLFlow, TFX, Kubeflow, etc.)

### 6.3 Incident Response

ML systems fail differently than traditional software (for example, *silent data drift*: gradual shift in data distribution causing unreliable predictions). A strong incident response plan reduces downtime and risk.

**Key steps:**
1. **Detection:**  
   - Alerts from monitoring (e.g., prediction error rate spikes).  
   - Business feedback (e.g., fraud model misses).
2. **Triage:**  
   - Classify incident severity (critical vs. degraded).  
   - Assign response team.
3. **Containment:**  
   - *Roll back* to last stable model or dataset snapshot.  
   - Switch traffic (blue-green / shadow model fallback).
4. **Resolution:**  
   - Fix root cause (data pipeline bug, corrupted features, infrastructure).
5. **Postmortem:**  
   - *Document* incident timeline, root cause, resolution steps.  
   - Add new tests/monitors to prevent recurrence.

**Best practices:**
- Maintain **runbooks** for common failures.  
- Keep **versioned artifacts** (datasets + models) to enable rollbacks.  
- Practice **chaos testing** for ML (simulate drift, corrupted features).  
- Assign **on-call rotation** for ML platform engineers.

### B. Templates & Examples

#### Basic Production Workflow

In production MLOps, the data and model workflows must balance **stability** (reliable inference) with **reproducibility** (auditable, research-friendly lineage).

Below is a typical hybrid pattern that combines Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Data Factory (ADF) / Spark ETL, and DVC for data versioning.

**Example Flow**
1. **Data Ingestion** → Raw data lands in ADLS.
2. **ETL/Curated Layer** → ADF or Spark jobs process raw data into curated, time-stamped snapshots, e.g.  
   `abfss://datalake/curated/transactions/2025-08-23/`.
3. **Version Tracking (DVC)** →  
   - `dvc add` registers the curated snapshot into Git.  
   - The Git commit + DVC metadata ensure exact dataset lineage is captured.
4. **Model Training** →  
   - Training jobs resolve the dataset path via `dvc.api.get_url()`.  
   - This guarantees reproducibility of experiments across time.
5. **Production Inference** →  
   - Inference services **skip DVC**.  
   - They read directly from `abfss://datalake/curated/transactions/latest/` for low-latency access.
6. **Disaster Recovery & Audit** →  
   - If `latest/` is corrupted or a rollback is required, production can fall back to a DVC-tracked snapshot.  
   - Historical model runs are reproducible by pulling the corresponding dataset snapshot from Git + DVC.

**Production Path:**  
`ADLS → ADF/Spark → ADLS → Direct Access`

**Research Path:**  
`ADLS → ADF/Spark → ADLS → DVC → Git → Reproducible ML`

**Code Example (Spark + DVC Fallback)**

```python
# Production fallback pattern
try:
    # Read the latest curated data
    df = spark.read.parquet("abfss://datalake/curated/transactions/latest/")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Latest data failed: {e}")
    
    # Get path to last known-good DVC snapshot (resolved to ADLS blob)
    good_path = dvc.api.get_url(
        "curated/transactions/",
        repo="https://github.com/org/data-versioning",
        rev="last-stable"
    )
    df = spark.read.parquet(good_path)
```

**Key Principles**
- **Do not** load large datasets with `dvc.api.read` → always use `dvc.api.get_url()` to resolve paths in blob storage.
- DVC is metadata only: It tracks which ADLS paths correspond to which Git commits.
- **Runtime services** (inference, dashboards, APIs) should use direct curated tables, not DVC.
- **Reproducibility & Compliance**: DVC enables re-running training or audits with exact historical data snapshots.

**Other Tools in the Workflow**
- **Delta Lake / Apache Hudi / Iceberg**
    - Add time-travel queries and schema evolution on ADLS data.
    - Complements or replaces DVC for dataset versioning at scale.
    - Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions VERSION AS OF 123;
```
- **MLflow**
    - Track experiments, hyperparameters, metrics, and model artifacts.
    - Tightly couples with DVC to record which dataset snapshot was used for training.
    - Example: Log dataset hash (dvc.lock) in MLflow run metadata.
- **Feast (Feature Store)**
    - Provides versioned, consistent feature definitions for online/offline use.
    - Ensures features served in training match what is served in production.
    - Works alongside curated ADLS snapshots for point-in-time correctness.
- **Great Expectations / Deequ**
    - Automated data validation checks before moving snapshots to “curated”.
    - Ensures downstream ML is not trained on corrupted or low-quality data.
- **Orchestration (Airflow / Prefect / Kubeflow Pipelines / Azure ML Pipelines)**
    - Automates the workflow:
        - `Ingest → Validate → Curate → DVC Add → Train → Deploy → Monitor.`
    - Allows retraining based on time or drift triggers.
