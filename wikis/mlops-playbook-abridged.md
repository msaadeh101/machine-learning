## 1.1 MLOps Overview

- The MLOps Lifecycle is a continuous loop that can be broken down into several key stages. It is an iterative cycle of experimentation, deployment and improvement.

### Experimentation and Development

- This is the initial phase where data scientists and ML engineers explore data, train models, and experiment with different algorithms. The focus is rapid iteration and tracking experiments.

**Key Activities**:
- **Data Exploration and Feature Engineering**: Prepare and transform raw data into features suitable for model training.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Building and training various models, then evaluating performance based on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Includes cross-validation and train/validation/test splits.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Logging parameters (data based), hyperparameters (model based), metrics, artifacts (models, datasets), and environment details (libraries, runtime) for each experiment, ensuring reproducability and a clear history.

### CICD for ML

- Once a model is ready for deployment, the CI/CD pipeline automates the process of getting it into production.

**CI for ML**:
- Differs from Traditional CI. Involves testing code as well as data and the trained model. A robust CI pipeline automatically retrains the models when new data becomes available or underlying code changes.

**CD for ML**:
- This stage automates deployment of trained model to production (dev, stage, etc) as a web service, batch processing job or to an edge device.

### Operations and Monitoring

After a model is deployed, MLOps focuses on ensuring its performance and stability over time.

- **Model Monitoring**: a critical part of MLOps. It involves monitoring the models performance on live data, looking for signs of *Model Drift* or *Data Drift*:
    - **Model drift**: AKA Concept drift. The relationship between input features and target variable has changed.
    - **Data drift**: The statistical properties of the incoming data have changed, causing teh model to perform poorly.

- **Retraining and Redeployment**: When monitoring indicates a decline in performance, the model needs to be retrained on new data. This triggers the entire MLOps pipeline from experimentation to deployment.


## 1.2 Teams & Roles

MLOps is inherently cross-disciplinary, it bridges the gap between different teams and stakeholders.

**Key Roles**:
- **Data Scientists**:
    - Focus on research, data exploration, feature engineering, and model development.
    - Define business problems as ML tasks and evaluate models with appropriate metrics.
- **ML Engineers**:
    - Productionize models: Optimize, refactor, and package for scalable deployment.
    - Build pipelines for training, evaluation, and serving.
    - Bridge handoff between research (data scientists) and operations (DevOps).
- **DevOps / MLOps Engineers**:
    - Ensure reliable infrastructure for training and serving (Cloud, K8, CI/CD).
    - Manage deployment automation, versioning, monitoring and scalability.
    - Apply DevOps principles of automation, reproducability, observability to ML systems.
- **Data Engineers**:
    - Build and Maintain data pipelines to provide clean, reliable, and timely data.
    - Handle data ingestion, transformation and storage at scale (ETL/Data lake)
- **Product Managers / Business Stakeholders**:
    - Align model development with business objectives and KPIs.
    - Prioritize experiements and balance trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

## 1.3 Maturity Assessment

### Level 0: Manual Process (No MLOps)

This is the starting point for most orgs. ML models are developed and deployed in an ad-hoc, manual fashion.

- **Process**: Data scientists train models on their local machines or notebooks. Model artifacts are manually passed to a separate team for deployment, which is often a one-off event.

- **Pain Points**: Lack of reproducibility, no version control for data or models, no monitoring, and significant delays in deploying and updating models. This approach is brittle and not scalable.


### Level 1: ML Pipeline Automation

At this level, some parts of the ML pipeline are automated. The focus is on automating the model training and deployment process with a *repeatable pipeline*.

- **Process**: A *CI/CD pipeline* is introduced, automating the training and deployment of the model. When a new model is trained, the pipeline automatically packages and deploys it.

- **Key Enablers**: Use of a centralized ML platform (e.g., `Kubeflow`, `MLflow`) and version control for model code and data. This level reduces manual errors and improves deployment speed.

### Level 2: CI/CD

This level extends the existing CI/CD to the entire ML Lifecycle. It's about creating a fully integrated, automated system that responds to changes in code, data or environment.

- **Process**: The pipeline automatically triggers on code commits or data changes. Automated tests are run on the data, code, and model before deployment. *A/B testing* and *canary deployments* are often implemented to safely roll out new models.

- **Key Enablers**: Robust data and model validation tests, automated monitoring for data and concept drift, and integrated CI/CD tools. This level ensures a high degree of reliability and reproducibility.

### Level 3: Automated and Monitored Pipelines

This level focuses on the operational aspects of MLOps. The pipeline is not only automated, but now continuously monitored for performance and triggered for retraining. 


- **Process**: The system automatically monitors model performance in production. When a decline in performance is detected (e.g., due to data or concept drift), the system automatically triggers a new training run and, if successful, a redeployment of the new model. This creates a fully autonomous feedback loop.

- **Key Enablers**: Advanced monitoring dashboards, alerting systems, and automated retraining triggers. This level reduces the need for constant human intervention and ensures models stay relevant over time.


### Level 4: Self-Healing and Governance

This is the *pinnacle* of MLOps maturity. The system is not only automated but also *self-correcting* and fully integrated with robust governance and security practices.

- **Process**: The platform includes self-healing capabilities, automatically recovering from pipeline failures or model serving issues. There are integrated governance features for model lineage, auditing, and compliance.

- **Key Enablers**: Advanced platform orchestration, automated security scans, and a comprehensive audit trail for every model and data version. This level is characteristic of highly regulated industries or large-scale, mission-critical ML applications.

- **Relevant tools**:
    - **Workflow Orchestration and Automation**: Kubeflow pipelines, Airflow, Dagster, Argo.
    - **Model Monitoring and Detection Drift**: WhyLabs, Prometheus/Grafana, Fiddler AI.
    - **Experiment Tracking and Registry**: MLFlow, W&B,, Vertex AI Model Registry.
    - **CI/CD**: Jenkins, Github Actions, Tekton, DVC (for versioning datasets).
    - **Serving and Deployment**: KFServing, Seldon Core, BentoML, Azure ML Endpoints.
    - **Alerting and Incidents**: Grafana Alerting, Opsgenie, CloudWatch.
